# Editorial by HTML5Up #

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0bb48e8c-a441-4349-a132-b2c0c2577709/deploy-status)](https://nuxt-editorial.netlify.app)

Nuxt 3 port of [HTML5Up's Editorial](https://html5up.net/editorial) theme.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking" sidebar and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP.
