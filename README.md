# Editorial by HTML5Up #

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0bb48e8c-a441-4349-a132-b2c0c2577709/deploy-status)](https://nuxt-editorial.netlify.app)

Nuxt 3 port of [HTML5Up's Editorial](https://html5up.net/editorial) theme.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking" sidebar and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```zsh
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```zsh
pnpm run dev
```

Building Sass to CSS:
You need `sass` to be installed globally for this command to work,
```zsh
pnpm buildcss
```
This also enters watch mode so it keeps updating main.css on changes to the sass styles until you exit the command.

## Production

Build the application for production:

```zsh
pnpm run build
```
